# RPGMakerVXtoMVConverter
Convert assets from RPGMaker VX to  RPGMaker MV resolution

fork of the tool that [Cloud Knight](https://rpgmakermv.co/members/cloud-knight.93/) posted on RPGMakerMV.co that you can find [Here](https://rpgmakermv.co/threads/the-best-re-sizer-possible-mostly-for-vx-ace-to-mv-with-tut.337/)

# Instruction
1. Paste all the .png assets you want to convert in the same directory of the bat file
2. Launch the convertall.bat file
3. wait for the process to finish

For default it uses the slowest (best quality) method for conversion. If you want to change it, open the rpgMakerScaler.bat with a text editor and set the variable to the preferred mode.
